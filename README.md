# minimal-cursor
A simple (albeit a bit janky) custom CSS + JS mouse cursor for my portfolio site. Has several known issues (one being not updating its position while scrolling the page), however I haven't yet found a good solution for that. If you're more knowledgable in JS than me, feel free to create a PR.
